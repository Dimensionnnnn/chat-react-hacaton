As part of this hackathon task, it was necessary to implement a web chat with the ability to send a message to a person from the contact list.

Chat script:
1. We go to the site, enter the login, under which we will go and click "Login"
2. Next, in the list on the left, select the username and send him a message.
3. It is important that there are several users and that you can switch between them, while seeing messages for these users
